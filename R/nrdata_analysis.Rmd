This R Markdown document is made interactive using Shiny. Unlike the more
traditional workflow of creating static reports, you can now create documents
that allow your readers to change the assumptions underlying your analysis and
see the results immediately. 

To learn more, see [Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html).

## Inputs and Outputs

You can embed Shiny inputs and outputs in your document. Outputs are
automatically updated whenever inputs change.  This demonstrates how a standard
R plot can be made interactive by wrapping it in the Shiny `renderPlot`
function. The `selectInput` and `sliderInput` functions create the input
widgets used to drive the plot.

```{r eruptions, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

## Embedded Application

It's also possible to embed an entire Shiny application within an R Markdown
document using the `shinyAppDir` function. This example embeds a Shiny
application located in another directory:

```{r tabsets, echo=FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("examples/06_tabsets", package = "shiny"),
  options = list(
    width = "100%", height = 550
  )
)
```

Note the use of the `height` parameter to determine how much vertical space the
embedded application should occupy.

You can also use the `shinyApp` function to define an application inline rather
then in an external directory.

In all of R code chunks above the `echo = FALSE` attribute is used. This is to
prevent the R code within the chunk from rendering in the document alongside
the Shiny components.







```{r exploration, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

load("nrdata.RData")

ggplot(nrdata, aes(win_type, turns_played)) +
       geom_boxplot()

by(nrdata$turns_played, nrdata$win_type, summary)
summary(nrdata$runner_score[nrdata$win_type == "agenda" &
                            nrdata$winner == "runner"])
ggplot(nrdata[nrdata$win_type == "agenda" & nrdata$winner == "corp", ],
       aes(turns_played - 10)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, boundary = 0)

```

### The Shifting Meta

I wanted to practice data analysis in R and decided to take closer look at the
last OCTGN data set that was made available in Feb 2015 thanks to db0.

Here the first preliminary graph that shows a global view of the meta over time,
i.e. changes with each new release (from Trace Amount to The Source):

* Each frame is a snap shot of the meta for a specific RELEASE (indicated in
the title) of all players on OCTGN.
* Each column is a single RUNNER.
* Each row is a single CORP.
* Each circle represents the specific matchup between the runner and the corp
of the intersection (e.g. NEH vs. Andromeda).
* The size of each circle indicates MATCHUP FREQUENCY during a specific release (i.e number of games of a specific matchup divided by total number of games).
* The color of each circle represents the CORP WIN RATE of that matchup during a specific release, with light grey representing 50% (i.e split), shades of blue > 50%
(i.e. favorably for corp), and shades of red a corp win rate < 50% (i.e.
favorably for runner).

Here some general guidelines on how to interpret the graph:

1. If a lot of circles in a single row are large then the corresponding corp is
popular.
1. If a lot of circles in a single row are blue then the corp is successful.
1. Correspondingly, large, red circles in a single column indicate a popular and
succesful runner.
1. If a lot of circles in all rows and columns are blue then corps dominate
the meta, if red then runners.

Some stray observations:

* Newly released IDs are initally popular.
* Notice how the "Stronger Together" row is mostly red? Always.
* The meta drastically shifts blue when Honor and Profit is released.
* After its release, NEH surges while MN and TWIY decline.

The next goals for further analysis are:
* Getting data for later releases.
* Implement interactive graphs (e.g. a slider to manually switch between
releases, look only at the top 25% of players).

What trends and patterns do you see in the data? What parameters would you like
to explore? Please let me know any feedback in the comments!
